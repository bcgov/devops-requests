## Step 0

**Are you looking to transfer a repo to the public bcgov GitHub organization?**
If you are a member of the public bcgov GitHub organization, you are already able to transfer the repo there yourself!

This template is for **private** repos only.

**Are you a member of the private BC Gov-managed organization already?**
If not, you will first need to join the bcgov-c organization by following these [instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov-c). 

**Are you sure you need to have your project code close-sourced?**
We highly recommend open source, secrets and any sensitive information should never be part of your codebase. 
If you still think your code needs to be private, please provide the details in the request.

## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/bcgov/devops-requests/issues

## Step 2
Read [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) on repo transfers to understand what is and is not transferred.


## Step 3
Fill out the following fields. For security purposes, please provide the following contact information to the email address - [Developer.Experience@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Developer.Experience@gov.bc.ca)

* Repo to transfer: 
* GitHub ID for repo owner: @
* GitHub Team(s) that should have access to the repo: 
* What access level the GitHub team(s) should have to the repo: 
* GitHub apps the repo uses (if any):

## Step 4
Coordinate with the Developer Experience team on when the repo will be transferred. You will need to make one of the Developer Experience team members an admin on your repo so we can transfer it into the bcgov-c organization.

## Step 5
Once your repos has been transferred, create a team to manage access to it (if a team does not already exist). All team members will need to be members of the bcgov-c organization. If they are not already members, they can join by following these [instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov-c).
