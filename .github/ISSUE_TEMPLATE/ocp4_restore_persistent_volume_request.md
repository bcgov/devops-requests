## Restore a backup Persistent Volume (PV)
Please read through the documentation about [OCP4 Backup and Restore](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/platform-developer-docs/docs/automation-and-resiliency/netapp-backup-restore/) before proceeding with this request!

> Note that only the `netapp-file-backup` type of Persistent Volume can be restored from OpenShift.

### Step 1
Fill out the following fields

* Date: the date you need restored from
* Cluster: Silver/Gold/GoldDR
* Source PV: the source PV you need restored
* Destination PV: the destination path

> Note that the Source and destination can be the same PVC or separate. You can specify sub-folders instead of the whole volume.

> Note: both PVC source and destination must be a netapp-file-backup PVC on the same cluster.

> Note that we need the PV not the PVC name. ie: `pvc-<uuid>`
