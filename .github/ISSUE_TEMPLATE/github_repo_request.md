## Step 0

**Are you looking to make a public repository?**
If you are a member of the public bcgov GitHub Organization, you are already able to make a new repo there yourself!

This template is for **private** repos only.

**Are you a member of the private BC Gov-managed organization already?**
If not, you will need to request membership first. Join the bcgov-c organization by following these [instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov-c). 

**Are you sure you need to have your project code close-sourced?**
We highly recommend open source, secrets and any sensitive information should never be part of your codebase. 
If you still think your code needs to be private, please provide the details in the request.

## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/bcgov/devops-requests/issues


## Step 2
Are you requesting to:
- [x] Create a private repo
- [ ] Remove a private repo and/or move to public BC Gov-managed org


## Step 3
Fill out the following fields. For security purposes, please provide the following contact information to the email address - Developer.Experience@gov.bc.ca

* Project Name: 
* GitHub Org: bcgov or private
* Details on choosing private repo: 
* Preferred name for repo: 
* GitHub ID for repo owner: @

## Step 4
Once you have a private repo, create a team to manage access to it. All team members will need to be members of the bcgov-c organization. If they are not already members, they can join by following these [instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov-c).
